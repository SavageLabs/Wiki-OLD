###Installation

Installing SavageFactions is easier than you think, here are a few easy steps to get you up and running.

1. Download Essentials & Vault as they are required dependencies and the plugin will not run without them.
1. Download CoreProtect if you would like /f inspect functionality, make sure to get the version corresponding to your spigot version.
1. Turn off your server, the command stop will help you do so.
1. If you are switching to FactionsUUID or MassiveFactions to SavageFactions, it is recommended to delete /plugins/Factions folder.
1. Start your server
1. Open the /plugins/Factions folder, inside, there are 2 files you can edit, the Conf.json & Config.yml. The Conf.json can only be edited when the server is turned off if you would like to edit the conf while the server is running use the command.
1. Head over to the permissions list & configure them to the corresponding groups to your liking. Feel free to use permission kits as they are preconfigured permissions that can serve as a template.
